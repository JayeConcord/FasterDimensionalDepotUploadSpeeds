# MoreDimensionalDepotUpgrades
A mod for Satisfactory that adds a new MAM Research Tree. This new Tree allows you to further upgrade the Dimensional Depot with higher Upload Speeds and Bigger Storage Sizes.

The Upload Speeds are based on the vanilla Belts from the game. Meaning the fastest Upload Speed is 1200 items per minute, or the speed of the Mk6 Belt.

With the Bigger Storage Sizes, your Dimensional Depot can now hold more items, with the final upgrade allowing the Dimensional Depot to hold the same amount of resources as the Industrial Storage Container from within the game.
